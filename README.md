Word Girl
=====================
Comic Book web experiences layering 2D Canvas, SVG and HTML. The art and image files are generated using Photoshop Generator, which is essentially a node server interfacing with Photoshop.

To run generator plugin navigate to the 'generator-core-jrb-get-layer-shape' directory in terminal and run:
```
node app -f path/to/generator/plugins/dir
```
The plugin generates the images and a JSON file used to populate the web comic.
